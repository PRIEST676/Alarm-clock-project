About the Project :-

🔴 This project is an clocked based alarm project
🔴 You can set alarm at any desired time.
🔴 The most important thing about this project is it makes use of local storage of your browser that means if you accidentally close the tab or entire
window, the alarm you set is not gone. When you revisit the page you find it same as you left
🔴 It also remembers at what time did you set alarm last time
